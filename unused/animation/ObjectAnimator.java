/**
 * ObjectAnimator provides support for animating properties on target objects.
 * <p>
 * The constructors of this class take parameters to define the target object that will be animated
 * as well as the name of the property that will be animated. Appropriate set/get functions
 * are then determined internally and the animation will call these functions as necessary to
 * animate the property.
 * <p>
 * Use {@link PropertyValuesHolder} and {@link Keyframe} can create more complex animations.
 * Using PropertyValuesHolders allows animators to animate several properties in parallel.
 * <p>
 * Using Keyframes allows animations to follow more complex paths from the start
 * to the end values. Note that you can specify explicit fractional values (from 0 to 1) for
 * each keyframe to determine when, in the overall duration, the animation should arrive at that
 * value. Alternatively, you can leave the fractions off and the keyframes will be equally
 * distributed within the total duration. Also, a keyframe with no value will derive its value
 * from the target object when the animator starts, just like animators with only one
 * value specified. In addition, an optional interpolator can be specified. The interpolator will
 * be applied on the interval between the keyframe that the interpolator is set on and the previous
 * keyframe. When no interpolator is supplied, the default {@link TimeInterpolator#ACCELERATE_DECELERATE}
 * will be used.
