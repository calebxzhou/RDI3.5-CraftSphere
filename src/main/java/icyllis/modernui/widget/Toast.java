/**
 * A toast is a view containing a quick little message for the user.  The toast class
 * helps you create and show those.
 *
 * <p>
 * When the view is shown to the user, appears as a floating view over the
 * application.  It will never receive focus.  The user will probably be in the
 * middle of typing something else.  The idea is to be as unobtrusive as
 * possible, while still showing the user the information you want them to see.
 * Example is the brief message saying that your settings have been saved.
 * <p>
 * The easiest way to use this class is to call the static method that constructs
 * everything you need and returns a new Toast object.
 * <p>
 * Note that toasts being sent from the background are rate limited, so avoid sending
 * such toasts in quick succession.
