     * GridLayout uses the orientation property for two purposes:
     * <ul>
     *  <li>
     *      To control the 'direction' in which default row/column indices are generated
     *      when they are not specified in a component's layout parameters.
     *  </li>
     *  <li>
     *      To control which axis should be processed first during the layout operation:
     *      when orientation is {@link #HORIZONTAL} the horizontal axis is laid out first.
     *  </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The order in which axes are laid out is important if, for example, the height of
     * one of GridLayout's children is dependent on its width - and its width is, in turn,
     * dependent on the widths of other components.
     * <p>
     * If your layout contains a TextView (or derivative:
     * {@code Button}, {@code EditText}, {@code CheckBox}, etc.) which is
     * in multi-line mode (the default) it is normally best to leave GridLayout's
     * orientation as {@code HORIZONTAL} - because {@code TextView} is capable of
     * deriving its height for a given width, but not the other way around.
     * <p>
     * Other than the effects above, orientation does not affect the actual layout operation of
     * GridLayout, so it's fine to leave GridLayout in {@code HORIZONTAL} mode even if
     * the height of the intended layout greatly exceeds its width.
     * <p>
     * The default value of this property is {@link #HORIZONTAL}.
