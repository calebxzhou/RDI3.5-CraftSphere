/**
 * This transition tracks changes to the visibility of target views in the
 * start and end scenes and fades views in or out when they become visible
 * or non-visible. Visibility is determined by both the
 * {@link View#setVisibility(int)} state of the view as well as whether it
 * is parented in the current view hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>The ability of this transition to fade out a particular view, and the
 * way that that fading operation takes place, is based on
 * the situation of the view in the view hierarchy. For example, if a view was
 * simply removed from its parent, then the view will be added into a
 * {@link ViewGroupOverlay} while fading. If a visible view is
 * changed to be {@link View#GONE} or {@link View#INVISIBLE}, then the
 * visibility will be changed to {@link View#VISIBLE} for the duration of
 * the animation. However, if a view is in a hierarchy which is also altering
 * its visibility, the situation can be more complicated. In general, if a
 * view that is no longer in the hierarchy in the end scene still has a
 * parent (so its parent hierarchy was removed, but it was not removed from
 * its parent), then it will be left alone to avoid side-effects from
 * improperly removing it from its parent.</p>
