         * <p>
         * dW = F*dx, where dx is the piece of path traveled.

         * W = sum(dW) = sum(m * v * dv) = m * sum(v * dv)
         * Since the mass stays constant, the equation for final velocity is:
         * vfinal = sqrt(2*sum(v * dv))
         * <p>
         * Here,
         * dv : change of velocity = (v[i+1]-v[i])
         * dx : change of distance = (x[i+1]-x[i])
         * dt : change of time = (t[i+1]-t[i])
         * v : instantaneous velocity = dx/dt

         * vfinal = sqrt(2) * sqrt(sum((v[i]-v[i-1])*|v[i]|)) for all i
         * The absolute value is needed to properly account for the sign. If the velocity over a
         * particular segment descreases, then this indicates braking, which means that negative
         * work was done. So for two positive, but decreasing, velocities, this contribution would be
         * negative and will cause a smaller final velocity.
         * <p>
         * Initial condition
         * There are two ways to deal with initial condition:
         * 1) Assume that v(0) = 0, which would mean that the screen is initially at rest.
         * This is not entirely accurate. We are only taking the past X ms of touch data, where X is
         * currently equal to 100. However, a touch event that created a fling probably lasted for longer
         * than that, which would mean that the user has already been interacting with the touchscreen
         * and it has probably already been moving.
         * 2) Assume that the touchscreen has already been moving at a certain velocity, calculate this
         * initial velocity and the equivalent energy, and start with this initial energy.
         * Consider an example where we have the following data, consisting of 3 points:
         * time: t0, t1, t2
         * x   : x0, x1, x2
         * v   : 0 , v1, v2
         * Here is what will happen in each of these scenarios:
         * 1) By directly applying the formula above with the v(0) = 0 boundary condition, we will get
         * vfinal = sqrt(2*(|v1|*(v1-v0) + |v2|*(v2-v1))). This can be simplified since v0=0
         * vfinal = sqrt(2*(|v1|*v1 + |v2|*(v2-v1))) = sqrt(2*(v1^2 + |v2|*(v2 - v1)))
         * since velocity is a real number
         * 2) If we treat the screen as already moving, then it must already have an energy (per mass)
         * equal to 1/2*v1^2. Then the initial energy should be 1/2*v1*2, and only the second segment
         * will contribute to the total kinetic energy (since we can effectively consider that v0=v1).
         * This will give the following expression for the final velocity:
         * vfinal = sqrt(2*(1/2*v1^2 + |v2|*(v2-v1)))
         * This analysis can be generalized to an arbitrary number of samples.
         * <p>
         * <p>
         * Comparing the two equations above, we see that the only mathematical difference
         * is the factor of 1/2 in front of the first velocity term.
         * This boundary condition would allow for the "proper" calculation of the case when all of the
         * samples are equally spaced in time and distance, which should suggest a constant velocity.
         * <p>
         * Note that approach 2) is sensitive to the proper ordering of the data in time, since
         * the boundary condition must be applied to the oldest sample to be accurate.

         * Solves a linear least squares problem to obtain a N degree polynomial that fits
         * the specified input data as nearly as possible.
         * <p>
         * Returns true if a solution is found, false otherwise.
         * <p>
         * The input consists of two vectors of data points X and Y with indices 0..m-1
         * along with a weight vector W of the same size.
         * <p>
         * The output is a vector B with indices 0..n that describes a polynomial
         * that fits the data, such the sum of W[i] * W[i] * abs(Y[i] - (B[0] + B[1] X[i]
         * + B[2] X[i]^2 ... B[n] X[i]^n)) for all i between 0 and m-1 is minimized.
         * <p>
         * Accordingly, the weight vector W should be initialized by the caller with the
         * reciprocal square root of the variance of the error in each input data point.
         * In other words, an ideal choice for W would be W[i] = 1 / var(Y[i]) = 1 / stddev(Y[i]).
         * The weights express the relative importance of each data point.  If the weights are
         * all 1, then the data points are considered to be of equal importance when fitting
         * the polynomial.  It is a good idea to choose weights that diminish the importance
         * of data points that may have higher than usual error margins.
         * <p>
         * Errors among data points are assumed to be independent.  W is represented here
         * as a vector although in the literature it is typically taken to be a diagonal matrix.
         * <p>
         * That is to say, the function that generated the input data can be approximated
         * by v(t) ~= B[0] + B[1] t + B[2] t^2 + ... + B[n] t^n.
         * <p>
         * The coefficient of determination (R^2) is also returned to describe the goodness
         * of fit of the model for the given data.  It is a value between 0 and 1, where 1
         * indicates perfect correspondence.
         * <p>
         * This function first expands the X vector to a m by n matrix A such that
         * A[i][0] = 1, A[i][1] = X[i], A[i][2] = X[i]^2, ..., A[i][n] = X[i]^n, then
         * multiplies it by w[i]./
         * <p>
         * Then it calculates the QR decomposition of A yielding an m by m orthonormal matrix Q
         * and an m by n upper triangular matrix R.  Because R is upper triangular (lower
         * part is all zeroes), we can simplify the decomposition into an m by n matrix
         * Q1 and a n by n matrix R1 such that A = Q1 R1.
         * <p>
         * Finally we solve the system of linear equations given by R1 B = (Qtranspose W Y)
         * to find B.
         * <p>
         * For efficiency, we lay out A and Q column-wise in memory because we frequently
         * operate on the column vectors.  Conversely, we lay out R row-wise.
