/**
 * Implementation of the {@link ContextMenu} interface.
 * <p>
 * Most clients of the menu framework will never need to touch this
 * class.  However, if the client has a window that
 * is not a content view of a Dialog or Activity (for example, the
 * view was added directly to the window manager) and needs to show
 * context menus, it will use this class.
 * <p>
 * To use this class, instantiate it via {@link #ContextMenuBuilder()},
 * and optionally populate it with any of your custom items.  Finally,
 * call {@link #showPopup(View, float, float)} which will populate the menu
 * with a view's context menu items and show the context menu.
